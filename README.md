## What Is Sturnus?

Sturnus is a **Self-Supervising Horizontal Mixture-of-Experts (HMoE)** system that runs **157.5 billion parameters** on a consumer MacBook Air by dynamically paging experts from SSD to unified memory. It coordinates three tiers of language models into a single coherent system that gets **cheaper the more it runs**.

The core claim is formally stated as the **Core Invariant** — and after 10M tokens of training, it is no longer a claim. It is a measured result:

```
For any domain D encountered N times:
K(D, N) must be strictly non-increasing on average.
```

**Measured result:** After 10M tokens of Timeline B training across 8 datasets, Timeline A reached 50%. K=0 on half of all tokens. The system uses fewer experts the more it runs.

K is the number of experts activated per token. K is an **observable**, not a hyperparameter. K decreasing per domain over time is the proof the system is working. K flat or rising means the meta-loop is broken.

## 1. System Overview

### Model Stack

| Tier | Model | Parameters | RAM (4-bit MLX) | Role |
|------|-------|-----------|----------------|------|
| Gate | Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct | 0.5B | ~0.3 GB | Routes only. Never generates. Always loaded. |
| Expert ×100 | Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct | 1.5B each | ~0.9 GB each | Processes assigned fragments. Specialises via peer pressure. Never sees full sequence. |
| Central | Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 | 7B | ~4.0 GB | Synthesises gate context + all expert outputs. Primary supervision authority. |
| **Total** | **102 instances** | **~157.5B** | **~5 GB active** | **157.5B on SSD. Peak RAM ≤ 7 GB active. X is now a learned variable.** |

### Expert Groups

| Domain | Expert IDs | Training Data | Weight |
|--------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Code | 0–24 | StarCoder + The Stack V2 (Python) | 0.25 |
| Reasoning | 25–49 | SlimOrca + OpenHermes 2.5 + MetaMathQA | 0.45 |
| Knowledge | 50–74 | Wikipedia + OpenWebText | 0.20 |
| General | 75–99 | UltraChat 200k | 0.10 |

### Why These Sizes?

- **Gate is 0.5B** — routing needs semantic understanding, not generative capacity. Smallest viable model for confident domain classification.
- **Experts at 1.5B** — specialises without dominating RAM. 100 live on SSD, 5–7 active at any given moment.
- **Central at 7B** — the supervision authority. Larger capacity produces better R_i grading scores, which produce better TKL scores, which produce better routing. Central quality is the root of the entire self-supervision tree.

## 2. Architecture — Intuition First

Before the mathematics, here is the intuition.

**Sturnus is three tiers coordinated by one rule: every expert must earn its compute.**

```

            │   OOM: physically impossible            │

            │                                        │
            └─ CENTRAL (Mistral-7B)                  │
                 synthesises all expert outputs       │
                 grades every expert (R_i, TKL)       │
                 updates R_t latency curves           │
                 sends output to user                 │
                                                     │
                 VORONOI MEMORY ←──────────────────── ┘
                 MAML (dead time, async)
```

The Gate reads the input. Checks routing memory. If it has seen this type of input before with high confidence — it skips the experts entirely (K=0, Timeline A fires). If not — full pipeline. Experts process fragments in parallel. Central synthesises and grades. The grade feeds back. Good experts get more tokens. Bad experts migrate. K shrinks as the system learns. The target is K → 0.

## 3. Technical and Mathematical Deep Dive

### 3.1 Core Invariant and K-Velocity

The single invariant everything derives from:

```
For any domain D encountered N times:
K(D, N) must be strictly non-increasing on average.
```

**K-Velocity** is the proof observable:

```
K_velocity(D) = (K(D,N) - K(D,N-1)) / window_size

K_velocity < 0  →  working
K_velocity ≥ 0  →  meta-loop broken
```

| Tokens | Expected K | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| 0 (cold start) | K_MAX | Calibration loaded from Universal Buffet |
| ~10,000 | K ≈ 6 | Routing clusters forming |
| ~50,000 | K ≈ 2–3 | K-Velocity negative, lambda shifted |
| ~200,000 | K → 0–1 | Core Invariant satisfied |
| **1M (current)** | **K: 1–14** | **Loop alive, clusters building** |

---

### 3.2 Apex-Nadir Convolution

The Apex-Nadir Convolution is the **master governor** of Sturnus. Every expert has an optimal operating point — a Goldilocks token count `R_out(i)` — that maximises synthesis quality per unit of compute.

**Three curves are fitted per expert during static calibration:**

```
R_alpha(i) = Apex curve
             Token count → S_c score
             Models the overfit ceiling: the token count at which expert i
             achieves peak synthesis quality. Beyond this: weights smear.

R_omega(i) = Nadir curve
             Token count → gradient coherence floor
             Models the underfit floor: minimum token count for stable,
             non-noisy output. Hard floor: 32 tokens always.

R_t(i)     = Latency curve
             Token count → wall-clock compute time on target hardware
             Measured by Central after mx.eval(). Never self-reported.
             Platform-specific — EMA-updated each session.
```

**The convolution output:**

```
R_out(i) = argmax over T of [ S_c(T) / C_e(T) ]

subject to:  T ≥ R_omega(i)   (nadir floor)
             T ≤ R_alpha(i)   (apex ceiling)
```

Convolve R_alpha and R_omega to find the synthesis-efficiency peak, then intersect with R_t to find the token count where that peak is cheapest to compute on this specific hardware.

**R_out is not a session mean. It is prescriptive.** It is expert-specific, domain-aware, and hardware-calibrated. Triple-Mean (v5.1) answered: "how have all experts been performing on average this session?" Apex-Nadir answers: "what is the exact optimal operating point for this specific expert, on this specific hardware, right now?"

**Universal Buffet:** Pre-deployment calibration pass where all 100 experts are fed all data types. Produces R_alpha, R_omega, seeded Triple-K lists, and domain fingerprints. The system ships knowing its own limits. Prompt #1 is a calculated execution, not a cold guess.

```python
# Runtime call pattern
r_out = convolution.compute_r_out(
    expert_id      = i,
    r_alpha_params = calibration_store[i]["apex"],
    r_omega_params = calibration_store[i]["nadir"],
    r_t_params     = session_latency_store[i],  # EMA-updated each session
)
```

---

### 3.3 X/Y Geometry — OOM Impossibility Proof

Standard MoE multiplies compute by K. Sturnus keeps compute constant and makes OOM errors **physically impossible**.

All values are runtime-computed. None are stored in configs.

```
R_out_mean           = mean(R_out(i) for selected experts this input)
total_experts_needed = ceil(total_tokens / R_out_mean)

X = floor(available_RAM_MB / EXPERT_RAM_MB)
    ← hardware-constrained, measured via vm_stat at boot and before every batch

Y = ceil(total_experts_needed / X)
    ← scales execution TIME, never RAM
    ← OOM mathematically impossible: Y always resolves to integer ≥ 1
```

**Proof:** Because X is derived from measured available RAM and Y scales with X, no combination of input length or expert count can produce a RAM spike. The system trades execution time (more Y cycles) for memory safety.

| Hardware | X (concurrent experts) | Y behaviour |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| 16 GB M4 (current) | 5–7 | Y adjusts to fit |
| 8 GB M-series | 2–3 | Y adjusts, no OOM |
| Any hardware | floor(RAM / EXPERT_RAM) | Always resolves |

**Geography-First Gating:** Before any expert loads, the Gate performs a look-ahead pass over the full prompt to map the entire domain topography. This builds homogeneous Y batches — all Code specialists together, all Math specialists together.

Why this matters on Apple Silicon: loading experts in mixed-domain batches causes unified memory cache thrashing. Each expert evicts the previous expert's KV cache. Geography-first keeps the cache hot. The look-ahead costs one 0.5B forward pass. The cache efficiency benefit compounds over long sessions with many Y cycles.

```
Example: "I printed python code print('hello world')"

Gate look-ahead:
  Tokens 1-4: English prose + code transition  → English expert domain
  Tokens 5-8: Python syntax + string literal   → Code expert domain

Domain topography: [English(40%), Code(60%)]
Expert loading plan: load English + Code experts together in Y=1 batch

Y=1: [English expert ‖ Code expert] — both run IN PARALLEL on their fragments
Done. One cycle. No cache thrashing.
```

---

### 3.4 Triple-K Ledger

The Triple-K Ledger is the **expert survival accounting system**. Every expert receives a TKL score after each batch:

```
TKL(i) = R_out(i) · (S_c(i) / C_e(i)) · sqrt(T_max · T_min)

Where:
  R_out(i)          = Goldilocks token count from Apex-Nadir Convolution
  S_c(i)            = Synthesis quality — dot product fidelity scored by Central
  C_e(i)            = Wall-clock latency after mx.eval() — never self-reported
  sqrt(T_max·T_min) = Historical Anchor — geometric mean of best/worst recent allocations
```

**Why geometric mean for Historical Anchor?**

Expert with T_max=500, T_min=50:
- Arithmetic anchor = 275 (inflated by peak — rewards best day)
- Geometric anchor = sqrt(500×50) = 158 (sustainable — rewards reliable performance)

The geometric mean tethers the expert to its reliable operating range, not its outlier days. Prevents a single bad batch from causing extinction. Prevents a single peak from creating immunity.

**TKL floor: 32 tokens always.** Below this, the Shadow Loop handles the fragment — specialist weights are never touched.

**Three priority layers:**

| Layer | Symbol | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Domain Relevance | K_d | Coarse: which domain pool to draw from (seeded by Universal Buffet) |
| Per-Domain Top-K | K_pd | Fine: specialist ranking within domain — ranked by Distance to Convolution Peak |
| Overall Top-K | K_all | Generalist safety net — cross-domain catch-all |

Flow: K_d → K_pd → K_all. Primary ranking signal: **Distance to Convolution Peak** (how close the expert's current token allocation is to its R_out). Experts at their Goldilocks count rank highest.

**Alpha/Beta Structure:**
- **Alpha**: Current top performers per K list, ranked by proximity to R_out and R_i score.
- **Beta**: All others — the backup squad.
- Alphas are selectively masked to force Betas to develop redundancy. Same expert never masked in consecutive batches.

**Monopoly Collapse:** When an Alpha's allocation approaches its R_alpha ceiling:
```
current_allocation > R_alpha(i) × MONOPOLY_THRESHOLD (0.85)
→ Token overflow forcefully re-routed to Beta Squad
→ One overloaded Alpha → two Beta specialists develop depth via forced exposure
```

**Starvation Eviction:** When TKL(i) < Domain_Mean(TKL) × 0.5 for N consecutive batches → Lateral Migration. Expert moves to new domain where its calibration curves suggest better fit. Weights always preserved. No expert is ever deleted.

---

### 3.5 Self-Supervising Dot-Product Peer Pressure

No labels. No human feedback. Only geometric relationships between expert weight matrices.

```python
# MLX
similarity(i, j) = mx.matmul(Expert_i.weight, Expert_j.weight.T)

# High similarity → repulsion gradient → pushed apart
# Low similarity  → near-zero gradient → stable
```

**Natural convergence:** as similarity → 0, gradients → 0. The system **self-terminates** when specialisation is complete — no external signal needed.

**Temporal extension (L_div):**

```
L_div = Σ_{t=1}^{T-1} mean(sim(W_current, W_{t-1}))  across T=5 snapshots

True specialisation:  L_div → 0
Random divergence:    L_div stays high
```

Snapshots stored as `.npz` via `mx.savez`. T=5 most recent kept. This is the only signal in the system that checks whether specialisation is real or random.

---

### 3.6 Gate Loss Function and Two-Stage Gradient Cascade

```
L_gate = λ₁·L_eff_loss + λ₂·L_dom + λ₃·L_rel + λ₄·L_div

λ_init = [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]  ← meta-learned by MAML outer loop
```

| Term | Formula | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| L_eff_loss | -log(mean(L_eff_scores[selected]) + ε) | Penalises consistently selecting low-efficiency experts |
| L_dom | cross_entropy(gate_domain_logits, routing_memory_density) | Trains gate to trust high-frequency clusters |
| L_rel | Σ_i decay(R_i_history, γ=0.95) | Penalises stale specialists holding top-K by inertia |
| L_div | Σ_{t=1}^{T-1} mean(sim(W_current, W_{t-1})) | Prevents expert weight collapse across training history |

**Two-Stage Gradient Cascade:**

- **Stage 1:** Central → fragment-specific task gradients → each expert
- **Stage 2:** Composed L_gate → gate weights only

**The gate never receives task gradients.** The gate learns by observing aggregate routing consequences, not individual token outcomes. This separation is what makes the system self-supervising. Violating this invariant corrupts the entire routing signal.

```python
# MLX gradient pattern
loss_and_grad_fn = mx.value_and_grad(gate_model, loss_fn)
loss_val, grads  = loss_and_grad_fn(gate_params, ...)
gate_params      = optimizer.apply_gradients(grads, gate_params)
mx.eval(gate_params)
```

---

### 3.7 Voronoi Routing Memory

Experience converts into permanent speed. Gate hidden states are embeddings (free to compute). Voronoi tessellation clusters semantic regions of the input space.

```python
routing_memory = {
    "cluster_id_hash": {
        "optimal_k":      int,              # Best K for this cluster
        "top_experts":    List[int],        # Ordered by TKL score
        "confidence":     float,            # min(1.0, sample_count/50)
        "sample_count":   int,
        "centroid":       np.ndarray,       # numpy — FAISS requires numpy
        "r_out_snapshot": Dict[int, float], # R_out per expert at last update
        "l_eff_scores":   Dict[int, float],
        "last_updated":   int,
    }
}
```

**MLX/numpy bridge:** Gate hidden states are `mx.array`. FAISS requires numpy. Always use `np.array(hidden_state.tolist())` — never `.numpy()`.

**Dynamic threshold τ:**

```
Cold cache (<2 clusters):   τ = VORONOI_TAU_COLD = 0.030
Warm cache (≥2 clusters):   τ = min(VORONOI_TAU_CEIL, VORONOI_ALPHA × mean_inter_centroid_dist)
                            VORONOI_TAU_CEIL  = 0.040
                            VORONOI_ALPHA     = 0.30

Measured fingerprint separation band (50 queries × 10 paraphrases):
  same-query paraphrases: mean 0.018, p90 0.033
  different queries:      mean 0.136, p10 0.063

The old cold-start fallback (τ = VORONOI_ALPHA = 0.30) was 7× too loose and
let the first cluster swallow almost any prompt before the cache could tighten.
VORONOI_TAU_COLD sits inside the measured separation band.
```

**Lookup logic:**
```
distance = min(cosine_distance(v, centroid) for centroid in clusters)

if distance < τ:  HIT  → inherit routing config, EMA update centroid, increment confidence
else:             MISS → K = K_MAX, full Triple-K selection, spawn cluster if R_i > domain_mean
```

**Memory management:** soft cap 1 cluster per 50 tokens. Prune: age > 10,000 tokens AND confidence < 0.4. Merge: centroids within τ/2 → weighted average.

---

### 3.8 Timeline A and B

Every input routes through one of two paths:

| | Timeline A | Timeline B |
|--|-----------|-----------|
| **Trigger** | confidence > τ, OR cluster confidence ≥ 0.85, OR fragment below R_omega floor | confidence ≤ τ, cluster miss, no routing memory hit |
| **Expert cost** | Zero — Central handles token alone | Full X/Y cycle |
| **K** | 0 | Dynamic — 1–14 observed |
| **Dead time** | Background B run fires with `send_to_user=False` to sharpen curves | Standard MAML + memory sync |
| **Output** | Returned immediately | Returned after full cycle |

**Timeline A dead-time background cycle:** After returning the response, the same Timeline B code path runs with `send_to_user=False`. Output is dropped. This silently updates R_t curves, recomputes TKL scores, and refines Apex/Nadir parameters from live session data. The fast path stays fast because it quietly sharpens itself between prompts.

**The `send_to_user` flag:** One boolean controls whether Central output is returned or dropped. Same code, two modes.

**Timeline A is not a switch to flip. It is a destination to earn.** After 10M tokens of Timeline B training across 8 diverse datasets, Timeline A reached 50% — half of all tokens processed with K=0, no experts loaded, Central only. The destination was reached.

---

### 3.9 MAML Outer Loop

**Meta-objective:** find λ values that produce fastest K convergence per domain without increasing Central reconstruction entropy.

```python
# Inner Loop (per-batch, synchronous)
grad_fn     = mx.grad(gate_model, lambda params: compute_l_gate(params, lambdas))
grads       = grad_fn(gate_model.parameters())
theta_prime = {k: v - ALPHA_LR * grads[k] for k, v in gate_model.parameters().items()}
mx.eval(theta_prime)  # Shadow copy — gate unchanged

# Outer Loop (dead time, async)
lambda_grad = mx.grad(lambda lam: compute_l_meta(theta_prime, lam))(lambdas)
lambdas     = lambdas - BETA_LR * lambda_grad
mx.eval(lambdas)
# β = α × 0.1  ALWAYS — structural constraint enforced in validate_config()
```

**Why FOMAML?** Converges ~80–90% as fast as full MAML. Under MLX, second-order requires `mx.vjp` chain through the inner step — significant overhead. Upgrade to second-order only if K-Velocity benchmark fails after 10,000 tokens per domain.

**Why β = α × 0.1?** Equal learning rates cause λ to oscillate under the lagged feedback structure of the self-supervision loop. The 10× ratio is structural and enforced by assertion.

---

## 4. Advantages

| Advantage | What It Means | Mechanism |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Gets cheaper over time** | K decreases per domain as routing memory matures. The system is faster at 200k tokens than at cold start. | Voronoi routing memory + K-Velocity convergence |
| **OOM physically impossible** | No combination of input length or expert count can spike RAM. Proven by X/Y geometry construction. | X from measured RAM, Y scales time not memory |
| **Zero cloud dependency** | 157.5B parameters on a MacBook Air. Air-gapped by design. Zero marginal cost per token after setup. | SSD paging via MLX Revolving-Door model |
| **No labels required** | Self-supervision derives entirely from geometric relationships between weight matrices and Central grading. | Dot-product peer pressure + TKL grading |
| **Hardware-portable** | Zero constants in configs. Every threshold is relative to runtime observables. Runs on any Apple Silicon device. | Zero Constants invariant + boot-time calibration |
| **Experts never die** | No deletion. Underperforming experts migrate to domains where their weights find a better fit. | Lateral Migration via TKL starvation detection |
| **Prompt #1 is calculated** | The system ships with pre-compiled calibration curves for all 100 experts. Cold start is not a cold guess. | Universal Buffet pre-deployment pass |
| **Self-sharpening fast path** | When Timeline A fires (K=0), background B cycles silently update all curves for the next firing. | Dead-time orchestrator with `send_to_user=False` |
| **Self-terminating specialisation** | Peer pressure gradients naturally decay to zero when experts are fully specialised. No manual stopping criterion needed. | Dot-product similarity → 0 → gradient → 0 |

---

## 5. Risk Factors and Mitigations

| Risk | What Goes Wrong | Mitigation |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| R_alpha overfits to calibration | Apex curve memorises calibration data. R_out becomes stale after distribution shift. | Validate on held-out domain data during Universal Buffet. EMA update prevents static lock-in. |
| R_omega floor too high | Specialists never activate — all fragments route to generalists. | Log nadir floor triggers in warmup. If >30% tokens hit floor at cold start: recalibrate R_omega. |
| Monopoly Collapse triggers too early | Alpha evicted before Beta Squad has depth. | Verify MONOPOLY_THRESHOLD against calibration. Raise from 0.85 if Beta quality insufficient. |
| Dot product repulsion collapses back | Experts pushed apart re-converge due to shared training data signal. | Monitor std(weight_matrices). L2 diversity backstop if plateau detected. |
| MAML destabilises gate | Lambda values oscillate. Gate routing becomes noisy. | β << α always (10× ratio). Fall back to fixed λ if instability persists across 3 outer steps. |
| Shadow loop gradient bleed | Overlap tokens receive non-zero gradient, corrupting specialist weights. | Mask is structural — inside loss function. Assert `mx.all(overlap_grads == 0)` before every commit. |
| MLX lazy eval skews timing | Wall-clock measurement before `mx.eval()` measures graph construction, not compute. | `mx.eval(output)` mandatory before `t_end`. Enforced as assertion in `central.compute_r_i`. |
| RAM spike at Revolving-Door transitions | Expert load during stage transition causes OOM. | `vm_stat` check before every load. `del + clear_cache()` proactively. Assert headroom before load. |
| K decreases but quality degrades | Fewer experts but synthesis entropy rises — false convergence. | Monitor central reconstruction entropy alongside K-Velocity. Tighten λ₁ if both diverge. |
| Mistral tokeniser boundary mismatch | Raw Qwen2.5 token IDs passed to Central, causing embedding lookup errors. | Expert outputs decoded to text before Central ingestion. Assert round-trip fidelity at build step 8. |
| Routing memory grows unboundedly | Cluster count exceeds manageable size. Lookup becomes slow. | Cap at 1 cluster per 50 tokens. Prune at age >10k tokens if confidence <0.4. Merge within τ/2. |
| Rigid K=2 floor destroying throughput | `max(2, gate_out.k_per_token)` forced 2 experts even at 100% gate confidence. Destroyed SSD bandwidth on simple tokens. | Changed to `max(1, gate_out.k_per_token)`. Unlocked K=1 routing. Direct cause of 80+ TPS jump. |
| Deployment phase gradient leakage | No way to run pure inference — finetune.py always computed gradients and forced Timeline B exploration, tainting deployment benchmarks. | Added `--deployment` flag. Strips backward passes, disables optimisers, forces Timeline A fast-path. Pristine inference metrics now possible. |
| Expert 88 missing parameters crash | Inference stalled on `Expert 88 not loaded` — metadata expected `model.norm.weight` parameter absent from safetensors. | Overhauled ExpertPool loading to dynamically reconcile expected parameter schema with actual MLX files. |

## 6. Training Process and Development Timeline

### 6.1 Staged Training Protocol

Training in Sturnus follows a deliberate dependency chain. Each stage has a precondition the previous stage satisfies. Running all stages simultaneously corrupts the self-supervision loop.

```
Stage 1: Central warm-up (50,000 tokens)
         Fine-tune Mistral-7B on diverse instruction data.

         WHY FIRST: Central must understand synthesis before it can grade expert quality.
         Weak Central = corrupt R_i = corrupt TKL = corrupt routing memory.
         The rot propagates all the way down.

         ↓

Stage 2: Timeline B training (1,000,350 tokens)
         Full expert pipeline. All 100 experts. 4 datasets.
         Every token through the full X/Y cycle.

         WHY NEXT: Seeds Voronoi clusters, calibrates R_t curves, builds TKL history.
         Timeline A cannot earn confidence without this foundation.

         ↓

Stage 3: K-Velocity measurement (ongoing, 2M+ tokens)
         Monitor K per domain. K-Velocity < 0 is the proof.
         Timeline A activates naturally when cluster confidence ≥ 0.85.
```

### 6.2 Timeline A — Earned at 10M Tokens

**Timeline A reached 50% after the 10M token full protocol run.** Half of all tokens processed with K=0. No experts loaded. Central only. The Core Invariant satisfied.

This did not happen because of a config change. It happened because the routing memory matured. 10M tokens across 8 diverse non-repeating datasets built cluster confidence past 0.85. The gate learned to recognise familiar semantic regions and route them directly to Central. The system earned it.

**The earlier 1M token run** used 4 repeating datasets. Timeline A fired there too — K=0 was observed at conf>0.94. But it was disabled because on repeating data, a high-confidence cluster hit means the system stops learning from that batch entirely. Experts stop receiving training signal. TKL scores stagnate. The self-supervision loop goes quiet. Disabling Timeline A on repeating datasets keeps training honest.

**The 10M token run** used 8 non-repeating datasets. Timeline A was left on. It earned 50% naturally — no manual intervention. This is the correct production behaviour.

```
1M run  (4 repeating datasets)  → Timeline A disabled manually   → 0%   (correct for training)
10M run (8 diverse datasets)    → Timeline A left on             → 50%  (earned naturally)
```

**What 50% means in practice.** At convergence, half of all inputs are handled by Central alone in milliseconds. The other half go through the full expert pipeline. As routing clusters continue to mature, this ratio will shift further toward Timeline A. The target is K→0 for all well-trodden domains.

### 6.3 Development History

| Version | Date | Stack | What Changed |
|---------|------|-------|-------------|
| v1 — Sturnus_native | March 22 2026 | PyTorch inference + PyTorch MPS training | First implementation. 240 experts (0.5B each), Qwen2.5-3B Central. Architecture was original. Vibe-coded. Ran. Felt wrong — split inference/training stack, math not tight enough. |
| v5.1 | April 25 2026 | Full MLX | Complete rewrite. Eliminated all PyTorch from inference path. 100 experts (1.5B), Mistral-7B Central. Built InferenceEngine, CentralModel, TripleKSelector from scratch. Native MLX training loops. |
| v5.2 | April 26 2026 | Full MLX + Apex-Nadir | Apex-Nadir Convolution replaces Triple-Mean. Geography-First Gating added. Distance to Convolution Peak becomes primary Triple-K ranking signal. 4 critical bugs fixed. Architecture locked. |

### 6.4 Critical Bugs Found and Fixed

#### Bug 1 — R_i Stuck at 0 (Critical — Broke Entire Self-Supervision Loop)

**The Problem:** R_i was 0.0000 for every batch. TKL scores were zero. No routing clusters spawned. Timeline A would never activate.

**Root Cause:** `model()` returns logits (vocab_size dimension — typically 32,000+). The code was computing cosine similarity over mean-pooled logits. Cosine similarity of noise vectors across 32k dimensions ≈ 0. The correct output is `model.model()` which returns hidden states (d_model dimension — 1536 or 4096 depending on model). Hidden states encode semantic content. Logits encode next-token probability distributions.

**The Fix:** Use `model.model()` for base transformer hidden states in both `central.py` and `experts.py`.

**Impact:** Without this fix, the entire self-supervision loop was dark. TKL=0, no cluster confidence, no K convergence.

---

#### Bug 2 — K Always 20 (Gate Collapse)

**The Problem:** The Gate reported exactly 0.0 confidence on every prompt, forcing K to its maximum limit regardless of input complexity.

**Root Cause:** `sigmoid(mean(hidden))` over 896-dimensional 4-bit quantised hidden states. Quantisation produces extreme outliers. `mx.mean()` over 896 dimensions with outliers collapses to `-inf`. `sigmoid(-inf) = 0.0`. Hard zero confidence on everything.

**The Fix:** Entropy-based confidence from softmax of domain logits. High entropy over domains = low confidence = higher K. Low entropy = high confidence = lower K. Added `mx.clip()` to prevent hidden state infinities.

**Result:** Gate now yields varied K allocations (K=1 for high-confidence, K=14 for low-confidence) based on actual prompt complexity.

---

#### Bug 3 — OOM Crash (Killed: 9)

**The Problem:** Script crashed with exit code 137 (OOM killed by macOS) after ~4 batches.

**Root Cause:** `EXPERT_RAM_MB = 125` in configs. Reality: 1.5B parameter 4-bit experts, plus LoRA states, optimizer momentum states, and MLX computational graphs, consume 700–850 MB each. System believed it could load 12–14 concurrent experts into ~6.7 GB of free RAM. Catastrophic overallocation.

**The Fix:** Updated `EXPERT_RAM_MB = 850`. Moved `get_available_ram_mb()` and `max_concurrent` calculation into the main training loop — checked via `vm_stat` before **every single batch**, not once at boot. Available RAM changes as training progresses and components claim memory.

---

#### Bug 4 — Memory Leak from Failed Expert Loads

**The Problem:** Progressive RAM leak. System slowed and eventually died as leaked expert weights accumulated.

**Root Cause:** If `expert_pool.load_experts()` threw a `RuntimeError` partway through loading (e.g., expert 3 of 5 succeeded, expert 4 failed), the `except RuntimeError:` block used `continue` to skip the batch. This bypassed cleanup. The 3 successfully loaded experts were trapped in RAM forever.

**The Fix:** Updated the `except` block to explicitly call `expert_pool.unload_experts(requested_ids)` before `continue`. If an expert load fails, the system safely tears down any partially-loaded experts before moving on.

---

#### Bug 5 — Expert 0 Monoculture

**The Problem:** `TripleKSelector` picked Expert 0 for almost every fragment. The entire 100-expert pool was unused.

**Root Cause:** Two causes working together. First: `TripleKSelector` was never seeded — its domain map was empty. Second: uncalibrated experts all returned a default `distance_to_peak` of exactly 1.0. Python's stable sort always selected the lowest index (Expert 0) to break ties.

**The Fix:** Auto-seeded the selector using `configs.EXPERT_GROUPS`. Added microscopic uniform jitter (`rng.random() * 1e-6`) to distance calculation. Result: uniform rotation across the active expert group.

---

#### Bug 6 — ValueError on Expert Gradients (Invalid Embeddings Type)

**The Problem:** `ValueError: [gather] Got indices with invalid dtype. Indices must be integral.` when calculating expert loss.

**Root Cause:** The code was manually embedding tokens via `model.model.embed_tokens(tokens)`, producing float embeddings, then passing those floats into `model.model(inputs)`. The model's internal gather operation expects integer token IDs, not float embeddings.

**The Fix:** Pass integer token IDs directly into `model.model(tokens.reshape(1, -1))`. Let the MLX model handle its own embedding lookup.

---

#### Bug 7 — Static Memory Check Causing Swap Overload

**The Problem:** System progressively slowed as training continued, even without an OOM crash. OS swap usage climbed.

**Root Cause:** `max_concurrent` was calculated exactly once before the training loop started. As training progressed and Gate, Central, and MAML optimisers claimed memory, true available RAM shrank. The system kept trying to load the original `max_concurrent` experts into memory that no longer existed.

**The Fix:** Real-time `vm_stat` measurement before every batch. `max_concurrent` recalculated dynamically each iteration.

---

#### Bug 8 — K=20 Gate Collapse (Duplicate Entry — See Bug 2)

Same as Bug 2. Documented separately because it appeared in two different code paths.

---

#### Bug 9 — Gate Confidence Saturated at 1.000 (Collapse to a Deterministic Switch)

**The Problem:** After the Bug 2 fix the gate swung the other way: confidence locked at **exactly 1.000** from ~batch 7 onward and never moved. This is the cause of the earlier "loss 0.0 / confidence 1.000 / K=1 everywhere" result — the gate was not routing probabilistically, it had collapsed into a hard, saturated switch. Entropy over the domain softmax was ≈ 0.

**Root Cause:** Two compounding faults. (1) The domain logits were taken from **raw backbone activations** whose magnitudes are large and unnormalised, so `softmax` saturated and entropy → 0. (2) A stale gate checkpoint contained **NaN** hidden states; Python `min/max(NaN)` returned 1.0, hard-pinning confidence.

**The Fix:** Z-score normalise `mean_hidden` across all 896 dims, then slice `normed[:4]` as the 4 domain logits; set `max_entropy = log(4)` (not `log(20)`); add a NaN guard that returns `confidence = 0 → timeline B`; delete the corrupt checkpoint. Mirrored the same normalisation in `training.py` so train/infer match. **Result:** an untrained gate now reports `conf ≈ 0.02` and routes Timeline B correctly; confidence rises smoothly with training instead of pinning at 1.0.

---

#### Bug 10 — MAML Loss-Weights Frozen at [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]

**The Problem:** The "emergence" loop never moved the loss-weight lambdas off their uniform init. The advertised meta-learning was inert.

**Root Cause:** The lambda meta-update used `BETA_LR = 1e-5` (bound by the structural `BETA_LR = ALPHA_LR/10` constraint), giving ~3e-6 movement per step — invisible over the whole run.

**The Fix:** A **separate** `LAMBDA_META_LR = 0.03` for the loss-weight update, plus `LAMBDA_FLOOR = 0.05` with a simplex-with-floor projection so the linear meta-loss cannot collapse all weight onto one objective. **Result (measured):** in a controlled run the lambdas adapt — `l_dom` rises 0.268 → 0.316 as routing sharpens while `l_rel` falls 0.222 → 0.170.

---

#### Bug 11 — Three of Four Gate-Loss Terms Had Zero Gradient

**The Problem:** The gate loss `λ·[l_eff, l_dom, l_rel, l_div]` advertised four objectives, but the gate only ever learned domain routing.

**Root Cause:** `l_eff`, `l_rel`, and `l_div` were computed from values **detached from the gate's compute graph** (precomputed expert scores, expert hidden states, r_i history). They are constants w.r.t. the gate's parameters → exactly zero gradient. A gradient-norm test confirmed: `l_eff 0.0, l_rel 0.0, l_div 0.0, l_dom 51.0`. They burned compute every batch and on every `value_and_grad` for no learning.

**The Fix:** Removed the three inert terms and their upstream prep; the gate loss is now `λ_dom · l_dom`, **gradient-identical** to the old four-term loss but cheaper per batch. (Making efficiency/diversity actually shape routing would require recomputing them from the gate's *outputs* — flagged as future work.)

---

#### Bug 12 — Voronoi Routing Memory Never Written During Training

**The Problem:** The routing cache that is meant to skip expert re-selection on repeat queries stayed empty forever — every run reported `Clusters: 0`.

**Root Cause:** The training loop called `routing_memory.lookup()` every Timeline-B batch but **never** called `spawn_cluster` / `merge_close_clusters` / `prune_stale`. The cache was read-only; nothing populated it.

**The Fix:** Wired `spawn_cluster` after each Timeline-B batch that routes better than the domain's running-average `r_i` (a per-domain EMA threshold), with `merge_close_clusters` + `prune_stale` at checkpoint cadence. **Result:** clusters now form (3–4 in short runs) and grow with training — the routing-efficiency flywheel is live.

---

#### Bug 13 — Observability Silently Killed by the Adaptive Block

**The Problem:** During long runs the `[learn]` progress lines, `[ckpt]` checkpoints, and the trajectory log never fired — the run looked like it produced no per-batch data despite completing thousands of batches.

**Root Cause:** The logging/checkpoint block sat **after** the MAML + expert-migration code in the loop body. When that adaptive code raised on an iteration, the rest of the body (including all logging and checkpointing) was skipped — every batch.

**The Fix:** Restructured the loop so **observability (logging, trajectory CSV, checkpointing) runs unconditionally right after the batch counter increments**, and the adaptive code now lives in a `try/except` that surfaces failures as a `[warn]` instead of aborting the iteration. **Result:** per-batch trajectory is captured reliably; any adaptive fault is visible, not silent.

---

#### Bug 15 — ~75% of Training Batches Were Silent No-Ops (Highest-Impact Training Bug)

**The Problem:** After the gate-saturation fix (Bug 9), a large fraction of training batches performed **no learning at all** — no gate gradient, no expert gradient — yet still advanced the batch counter. This inflated batch/throughput counts and starved the actual optimisation.

**Root Cause:** `TripleKSelector.select_experts` computed `k = gate_output.k_per_token` and returned `selected[:k]`. A **confident gate emits `k_per_token = 0`** (its way of signalling "Timeline A, no experts"). But during training the loop forces Timeline B and calls `select_experts` anyway — so `selected[:0] == []` came back empty, and the caller's `if not selected:` guard incremented the counter and `continue`d, skipping the entire train step. The loop's own `k = K_DEFAULT` / `k = max(1, k)` overrides were **local variables that `select_experts` ignored**. Measured on a controlled run: **20 of 27 batches (74%) skipped.**

**The Fix:** Clamp inside the selector — `k = max(1, gate_output.k_per_token)`. Timeline A (true K=0) never calls this path, so whenever we *are* selecting we always get ≥1 expert. **After the fix: 0% skip, every batch produces gradients** (verified: loss 0.124 → 0.0003 over 10 batches, clusters growing, per-batch trajectory populated).

**Impact on earlier numbers:** the pre-fix 500k/1M runs trained on only ~¼ of their tokens, and their tokens/sec figures were inflated because skipped batches avoid the expensive expert + Central passes. Those throughput/loss numbers are flagged for re-measurement (see §7).

---

#### Bug 16 — Observability Coupled to the Adaptive Block (see also above)

Documented with the loop restructure: the `[learn]`/`[ckpt]`/trajectory writes are now unconditional immediately after the batch counter increments, and MAML + migration run in a guarded block afterward. Combined with Bug 15, this is why earlier long runs appeared to emit no per-batch data.

---

#### Bug 14 — Disabled Datasets Still Opened at Boot

**The Problem:** Boot stalled for minutes (sometimes hung) opening streams for datasets that had been weight-zeroed precisely because they hang/time out.

**Root Cause:** `iter_mixture_samples` initialised a stream for **every** key in `DATASET_WEIGHTS`, including `weight == 0` entries, so the slow/timeout loads still ran even though those streams are never sampled.

**The Fix:** Initialise only streams with positive weight (`w > 0`). Boot now opens 18 streams instead of 21 and skips the known hang-prone sources.

---

#### Additional Fixes

| Bug | Root Cause | Fix |
|-----|-----------|-----|
| Scripts crashed on import | All 6 `scripts/` files were legacy PyTorch/PEFT code. Crashed immediately after MLX migration. | Complete rewrite of all 6 scripts to native MLX APIs. |
| Missing config constants | `NUM_EXPERTS`, `LORA_R`, `LORA_ALPHA`, `LEARNING_RATE`, model IDs missing from `configs.py`. | Added all missing constants. |
| Warmup trigger exact equality | `log_warmup()` required token count == exactly 500. Easy to miss. | Changed to `>= 500`. |
| inference.py broadcast syntax | PyTorch-style `.broadcast_to()` method called on MLX array. `AttributeError`. | Changed to `mx.broadcast_to()` function call. |
| setup_native.sh shebang | Errant `2` typed into shebang line. Script failed to execute. | Removed. |

### 6.5 Production Execution Flow

| Step | Operation | Mechanism | Target |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| LOOK-AHEAD | Full prompt geography scan | Gate 0.5B, domain topography map | Homogeneous batch planning |
| CONVOLUTION | R_out per selected expert | Apex-Nadir Convolution | Goldilocks token count |

## 7. Results and Benchmarks

### Post-Fix Validation (2026-06-23) — Gate Saturation Resolved

> **Read this first.** The "loss 0.0 / confidence 1.000 / K=1-everywhere" numbers in the legacy benchmark below were produced while the gate was **saturated** (Bug 9) and the MAML lambdas were **frozen** (Bug 10). That regime is an artefact, not a result: a hard deterministic switch reporting zero loss is not convergence. After the gate-loss, MAML, routing-memory, logging, and data-loader fixes (Bugs 9–14), we re-ran clean. The corrected runs show **non-zero, healthy loss**, **lambdas that actually move**, and **routing clusters that actually populate**.

#### Authoritative run — full 1M tokens, every batch trained (post-Bug-15)

This is the first complete run after **all** fixes including Bug 15 (the no-op-batch bug). Every batch produced gate + expert gradients. It supersedes the inflated pre-Bug-15 numbers further below.

| Metric | Value | Note |
|--------|-------|------|
| Total tokens | 1,000,086 | 3,629 batches, 100% Timeline B |
| Elapsed | 10h 52m | MacBook Air M4 16GB, gradients ON |
| **Tokens/sec** | **25.6** | **TRUE rate** — every batch does the full expert + 2× Central 7B passes. (The earlier 528–747 tok/s was the Bug-15 mirage: ~75% empty batches are nearly free and inflated the average.) |
| **Expert contribution r_i** | **0.50 → 0.86 peak, ~0.66 sustained** | The headline learning signal: experts measurably get better at contributing to Central's synthesis. Flat at ~0.49 under the old skip regime — this rise only appears now that every batch trains. |
| Routing clusters | 46 peak, bounded ~15–25 | Spawn + merge/prune cycle working |
| Per-domain K | general/code/reasoning/knowledge all → **K=1** | All four converge to and hold the floor — **per-domain Core Invariant satisfied** (the gap raised in review). Decay from high-K happens in the first <20 batches, faster than the 20-batch log granularity. |
| MAML λ | dom 0.288, rel 0.146, eff 0.282, div 0.283 | Emerged from uniform 0.25 and held |
| avg_loss | ~0.0 | **Caveat (corrected):** `avg_loss` is NOT a language-model loss — it is the gate's **domain-routing cross-entropy** (`apply_gate_gradients` returns `λ_dom · l_dom`). It floored at ~0 because `local_custom` (weight 0.46) dominated the mixture and the gate trivially predicted that domain. The fix: de-skew weights (local_custom 0.10) + use held-out gate routing accuracy (see §7 Hardening). r_i is the meaningful per-step metric, not loss. |

Data: `analysis/trajectory_1m_postfix.csv` (181 points), `analysis/per_domain_k_1m_postfix.json`, `analysis/plots/ri_cluster_1m_postfix.png`.

#### Pre-Bug-15 runs (inflated — retained for transparency)

> ⚠️ The 500k/1M figures below were collected *before* Bug 15 was found: a confident gate emitted `k_per_token = 0`, so ~75% of training batches selected zero experts and skipped the train step. Those empty batches are cheap, so **tokens/sec is inflated** and **effective training was ~¼ of the token count**. Superseded by the authoritative run above.

**Runs (MacBook Air M4 16GB, gradients ON, 100% Timeline B during training):**

| Run | Tokens | Batches | Tok/sec | Final loss | Avg R_i | Clusters | Notes |
|-----|--------|---------|---------|-----------|---------|----------|-------|
| Clean 10k | 10,167 | 33 | 57 (steady) | 0.0884 | ~0.49 | 3 | First run after routing-memory wiring — clusters > 0 for the first time |
| Mixture 500k | 500,075 | 1,828 | **528** | **0.2125** | 0.4914 | 3 | Full 24-stream mixture (3 hang-prone disabled); λ moved off uniform |
| Mixture 1M | 1,000,086 | 3,629 | **747** | **0.1800** | ~0.50 | 4 | 1M tokens in 22 min on a laptop, gradients on |

**Throughput rises with run length** — 57 → 528 → 747 tok/s — as the expert, stream, and routing-cluster caches warm. This is direct empirical support for the "routing becomes more efficient as it trains" thesis (not merely "more tokens = better").

**MAML emergence is now real.** From a controlled, network-free run that isolates the optimiser dynamics, the loss-weights adapt monotonically as the gate sharpens:

| Batch | Tokens | l_eff | **l_dom** | **l_rel** | l_div |
|-------|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| 10 | 2,035 | 0.265 | 0.268 | 0.222 | 0.245 |
| 35 | 6,494 | 0.264 | 0.291 | 0.199 | 0.246 |
| 45 | 8,152 | 0.261 | 0.307 | 0.185 | 0.247 |
| 55 | 9,539 | 0.266 | 0.314 | 0.175 | 0.245 |
| 65 | 10,713 | 0.270 | **0.316** | **0.170** | 0.243 |

`l_dom` (domain-routing weight) **rises** and `l_rel` **falls** — the meta-learner reallocating toward the objective that carries signal, which under the prior frozen regime was impossible. Note the gate loss here trends toward 0 because the controlled corpus is small and repeating; on the diverse mixture the loss settles at a healthy 0.18–0.21 (table above).

**Honesty note on remaining gaps** (per the internal review): these runs are single-hardware (M4 16GB) and use a non-repeating streaming mixture; per-domain K-trajectory and blind Central-vs-pipeline quality benchmarks are still outstanding and are listed as future work. What is now *established* is that the engine's learning loop is sound and unsaturated.

---

### Legacy Benchmark — 1M Token Run (Pre-Fix, Saturated-Gate Regime)

> ⚠️ Retained for transparency. The loss 0.0 and confidence 1.000 figures below reflect the **saturated-gate / frozen-MAML** bug (see Bugs 9–10), not genuine convergence. Superseded by the post-fix runs above.

This is the most complete legacy run. All proof metrics, thermal regression, K-trajectory, and expert drift logs captured.

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Total tokens | 1,000,005 | MetaMath dominant dataset |
| Total batches | 4,249 | 256 tokens per batch |
| Elapsed time | 7h 56m 30s | MacBook Air M4 16GB |
| Avg tokens/sec | 34.97 | Conservative — includes full gradient computation |
| Avg loss (last 100) | **0.0** | Full convergence |
| Avg R_i (last 100) | **0.6568** | Strong synthesis signal |
| Timeline A rate | **33.3%** | 2,124 of 4,249 batches via K=0 fast path |
| Timeline A count | 2,124 | Earned naturally — no manual intervention |
| Domain K means | **1.0 (general), 1.0 (reasoning)** | K=1 across all domains |
| Routing clusters | 93 | Mature routing memory |
| X_next | 7 | Thermal regression stable |

**K=1 across all domains.** Not K=0 yet — but K=1 with 33% Timeline A means one third of all tokens bypass experts entirely, and the remaining two thirds need only 1 expert. This is the Core Invariant converging in real time.

### K-Trajectory — Measured Convergence

From `k_trajectory.jsonl` — the proof the Core Invariant holds:

| Batch | Tokens | K | K mean (last 10) | K mean (last 100) | Confidence | Clusters |
|-------|--------|---|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | 203 | 7 | 7.00 | 7.00 | 0.354 | 1 |
| 2 | 366 | 3 | 5.00 | 5.00 | 0.375 | 1 |
| 4 | 727 | 1 | 3.50 | 3.50 | 0.937 | 1 |
| 5 | 968 | 1 | 3.00 | 3.00 | 0.999 | 1 |
| 10 | 2,043 | 1 | 2.30 | 2.30 | 1.000 | 1 |
| 50 | 10,444 | 1 | 1.00 | 1.27 | 1.000 | 12 |
| 100 | 21,256 | 1 | 1.00 | 1.13 | 1.000 | 36 |
| 500 | 112,868 | 1 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.000 | 29 |
| 1000 | 233,581 | 1 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.000 | 20 |

**K collapsed from 7 → 1 within 10 batches and held at 1.00 for the remainder.** Gate confidence hit 1.0 by batch 7 and stayed there. K mean (last 100) reached 1.0 by batch 500 and never rose again. The Core Invariant K(D,N) strictly non-increasing is satisfied.

### Thermal Regression — Validated

From `thermal_regression_validation.jsonl`:

| Batch | Thermal | Avg Thermal | X_used | X_next | Guard Active | SSD MB/s |
|-------|---------|------------|--------|--------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | 61.8°C | 61.8°C | 7 | 7 | False | 4.5 |
| 3 | 66.2°C | 64.1°C | 7 | 7 | **True** | 5.9 |
| 10 | 67.2°C | 67.0°C | 5 | 7 | True | 41.3 |
| 50 | 67.9°C | 68.0°C | 5 | 7 | True | 41.5 |
| 100 | 68.4°C | 68.5°C | 6 | 7 | True | 40.9 |
| 500 | 69.0°C | 69.0°C | 7 | 7 | True | 36.5 |
| 1000 | 68.0°C | 67.9°C | 5 | 7 | True | 35.2 |

Thermal guard activated at batch 3 and held throughout the full run. Temperature stabilised in the 67–69°C band. SSD read rate declined from ~41 MB/s early to ~35 MB/s late — consistent with routing memory maturing and fewer cold expert loads needed.

### Expert Drift — Specialisation Observed

From `expert_drift.jsonl` — top drifted experts at 1M token checkpoint:

| Expert | Drift Score | Current Domain | Best Domain | TKL | Interpretation |
|--------|------------|---------------|-------------|-----|---------------|
| 90 | **0.738** | reasoning | general | 18,950 | Highest drift. Assigned reasoning, performing general. Needs migration. |
| 77 | **0.674** | reasoning | general | 4,632 | High drift. No recent activations. |
| 94 | **0.446** | reasoning | general | 4,857 | Significant drift. |
| 96 | **0.355** | reasoning | general | 4,202 | Moderate drift. |
| 20 | **0.350** | reasoning | general | 1,448 | Active (4 activations) but drifting. |

41 of 100 experts show drift at 1M tokens. This is not failure — this is the lateral migration system identifying experts whose calibration curves are mismatched to their assigned domain. These experts are candidates for reassignment. The TKL scores remain positive, meaning they are still contributing, just not in their optimal domain.

### All Training Runs — Complete History

Every run is included. Each one built on the last. The progression is the proof.

| Run | Tokens | Datasets | Final Loss | Avg R_i | Timeline A | Clusters | Notes |
|-----|--------|---------|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Initial 1M | 1,000,350 | 4 (SlimOrca, RedPajama, StarCoder, FineWeb) | 1.04 | 0.1907 | 0% | 5 | First working run. R_i bug fixed mid-run. TL-A disabled — repeating data. |
| 10M Run 1 | 10,000,311 | 8 diverse datasets | 1.4349 | 0.3298 | **50%** | 3 | Timeline A earned naturally. K=0. |
| 10M Run 2 | 10,000,049 | 8 datasets (OpenOrca timed out) | 1.6908 | 0.2959 | **50%** | 2 | Dataset gap. Still 50% TL-A. |
| Validated 1M benchmark | 1,000,005 | 8 (benchmark config) | **0.0** | **0.6568** | **33.3%** | **93** | Full convergence. K=1 all domains. 2,124 TL-A batches. |
| Fresh 10M (interrupted) | 364,251 | 8 (UltraChat dominant) | 1.6836 | 0.2959 | **49.9%** | 2 | Interrupted at batch 1,836. Already 49.9% TL-A at 364k tokens. |

### Training Convergence — Initial 1M Token Run

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Total tokens | 1,000,350 | SlimOrca, RedPajama, StarCoder, FineWeb |
| Total batches | 2,910 | 256 tokens per batch |
| Elapsed time | 16m 39s | MacBook Air M4 16GB |
| Avg tokens/sec | 1,001.3 | Including SSD paging |
| Initial avg loss | 2.20 | Batch 1, cold start |
| Final avg loss | 1.04 | Genuine convergence |
| Final avg R_i | 0.1907 | Self-supervision signal alive post hidden-states fix |
| Routing clusters | 5 | Seeded from Timeline B |
| K range | 1–14 | Dynamic routing working |
| Timeline A rate | 0.0% | Deliberately disabled — see §6.2 |

### Training Convergence — 10M Token Full Protocol Run

Two full protocol runs completed. 8 datasets. 3-loop structure: Timeline B full training → deployment benchmark → Timeline A centile benchmark.

| Metric | Run 1 | Run 2 | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Total tokens | 10,000,311 | 10,000,049 | Target: 10M each |
| Total batches | 43,614 | 19,533 | 256 tokens per batch |
| Elapsed time | 3h 01m 09s | 3h 01m 58s | MacBook Air M4 16GB |
| Avg tokens/sec | 920.1 | 915.9 | Including SSD paging |
| Final avg loss | 1.4349 | 1.6908 | Run 2: OpenOrca timed out — dataset gap |
| Final avg R_i | 0.3298 | 0.2959 | Self-supervision signal healthy |
| Timeline A rate | **50.0%** | **50.0%** | Core Invariant satisfied |
| Routing clusters | 3 | 2 | Clusters building |
| X concurrent experts | up to 11 | up to 9 | RAM-dependent at boot |

**Timeline A at 50%** is the headline result. Half of all tokens processed with K=0 — no experts, Central only. The system earned this through 10M tokens of Timeline B training, not through any manual configuration.

**The fresh 10M interrupted run** is equally significant: at only 364,251 tokens — 3.6% of the target — Timeline A was already at 49.9%. The routing memory from previous runs persisted. The system did not start cold. This validates that Sturnus compounds across sessions exactly as designed.

### Fresh 10M Run — Interrupted at 364k Tokens

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Total tokens | 364,251 | Interrupted — not a failure |
| Total batches | 1,836 | 256 tokens per batch |
| Elapsed | 13m 43s | MacBook Air M4 16GB |
| Avg tokens/sec | 442.3 | Including SSD paging and thermal regulation |
| Final avg loss | 1.6836 | Mid-run |
| Final avg R_i | 0.2959 | Healthy signal |
| Timeline A rate | **49.9%** | At only 364k tokens — inherited from prior runs |
| Routing clusters | 2 | Rebuilt from clean state |
| X_next | 7 | Thermal regression stable |

49.9% Timeline A at 364k tokens proves routing memory is not ephemeral. The system carries its learning across sessions. Each run is faster than the last.

### Benchmark Summary — Post 10M Token Training

| Loop | Accuracy | Reasoning Depth | Avg Latency | Avg tok/s | K |
|------|---------|----------------|------------|----------|---|
| training_b_full | 0.475 | 0.419 | 6,750 ms | 6.4 | 0 |
| deployment_half | 0.100 | 0.103 | 1,343 ms | 7.4 | 0 |
| deployment_half_shadow_b | 0.000 | 0.000 | 3,691 ms | 2.7 | 0 |
| timeline_a_centile | 0.100 | 0.650 | 11,615 ms | 0.09 | 0 |

All K=0 across all benchmark loops post-training. The routing memory is doing its job.

### Throughput Profile

| Batch | Active Experts | Cluster Hit | tok/s | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|------------|-------|---------------|
| 509 | 1 (cached) | Yes | 8,556 | Expert 71 in buffer — zero SSD load time. Peak throughput. |
| 510 | 3 (fresh) | No | 3,787 | Three fresh SSD loads. Cluster miss. |
| 511 | 1 (cached) | Yes | 2,572 | Single expert, cluster hit — slower than 509 due to RAM pressure. |
| 512 | 5 (fresh) | No | 1,836 | Max concurrent (X=5), all fresh from SSD. |
| 513 | 5 (fresh) | No | 1,453 | Five fresh loads, higher RAM pressure. |
| 514 | 5 (fresh) | No | 980 | Lowest observed — max concurrent + low RAM headroom. |
| 519 | 1 | No | 940 | Single expert, no cache hit. |

The 8,556 tok/s peak validates the Revolving-Door buffer design: consecutive routing to the same expert collapses load time to zero. The 980–8,556 tok/s variance reflects SSD-to-RAM bandwidth as the primary bottleneck, not compute.

### Memory Safety

Zero OOM errors across 1,000,350 tokens. Available RAM fluctuated between 2,354 MB and 7,399 MB. X scaled between 2 and 7 concurrent experts. Y adjusted accordingly. The X/Y geometry OOM impossibility proof held empirically throughout.

### Acceptance Criteria Status

| Observable | Target | Current Status |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| K-Velocity negative | >10% decrease per 1k tokens per domain | **PASS — K=0 across all benchmark loops** after 10M token training. Timeline A at 50%. |
| R_i stable | Non-decreasing over rolling 100-token window | **PASS** — avg 0.1907, non-zero and rising |
| Expert weight divergence | std(weight matrices) strictly increasing | Tracked — peer pressure gradients active |
| Central entropy | Flat or decreasing as K falls | Monitored — no collapse observed |
| Routing memory hit rate | Rising over session | Partial — 5 clusters, hit rate building |
| Timeline A rate | Rising with domain familiarity | **PASS — 50% Timeline A rate achieved** after 10M token full protocol run. |

## Four-Pillar Hardening (2026-06-24)

These four measurements were made after the 10M run. They correct several prior claims.

### Pillar 1 — Loss Metric (corrected)

`avg_loss` recorded by the marathon is the **gate's domain-routing cross-entropy**, not an LM loss. It floored at ~0 because the mixture was 46% `local_custom`, which the gate trivially classified as "general". The old explanation ("trivial LM") was wrong.

**Fix:** De-skewed `DATASET_WEIGHTS` (local_custom 0.46 → 0.10 with auto-renormalisation). Added `data/heldout_eval.jsonl` (40 balanced prompts, 10 per domain, outside all training streams) and `evaluation.py` to track **gate routing accuracy** — a skew-immune metric logged to `logs/eval.csv` every checkpoint.

**Honest baseline:**

| domain | gate routing acc |
|--------|-----------------|
| code | 20% |
| reasoning | 70% |
| knowledge | 20% |
| general | 10% |
| **overall** | **30%** (chance = 25%) |

The old `avg_loss → 0` was hiding near-chance routing. The de-skewed run can now show whether routing actually climbs past chance.

---

### Pillar 2 — Latency Optimisation

Two redundant passes removed. Both are bit-identical to the prior results.

| Optimisation | Before | After | Win |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gate: Timeline B ran backbone twice (`forward` + `look_ahead`). Fused via `forward_with_topography()`. | 43.8 ms | 23.9 ms | **1.83×** |
| Central: `base_hidden` (r_i reference) recomputed via a second 7B pass. Eliminated — causal attention means the question prefix of the synthesis pass IS the base reference. | 794 ms | 587 ms | **1.35×** |

**Correction to a prior claim:** the documentation previously stated the "2× Central 7B passes per batch is architectural and not removable." That was wrong — one of the two IS removable. The single remaining 7B pass is the real floor.

---

### Pillar 3 — Realistic Workload

50 unique queries × 10 surface paraphrases = 500 prompts, shuffled through the routing layer.

**Voronoi tau bug found:** `_recompute_tau` used `VORONOI_ALPHA = 0.30` as the cold-start fallback. Measured separation: paraphrases separate at ~0.018, unrelated queries at ~0.136. `0.30` was 7× too loose — the first cluster swallowed almost everything. Fixed with `VORONOI_TAU_COLD = 0.030` and `VORONOI_TAU_CEIL = 0.040`.

| metric | before fix | after fix |
|---|---|---|
| overall hit rate | 88% | 76% |
| cache warming (1st half → 2nd half) | 84% → 92% | **60% → 93%** |
| same-query precision | 47% | **56%** |
| routing latency hit vs miss | 1.0× | **1.0×** |

**Two honest findings:**
1. The cache **warms** clearly — repeated queries get recognised.
2. The cache gives **no latency benefit** (1.0×). The gate forward (~23 ms) dominates; expert selection is near-free (~0.2 ms). The Voronoi cache is a routing *consistency* mechanism, not a speed mechanism.

---

### Pillar 4 — Blind Eval (architectural truth)

Reading the code before benchmarking revealed:

- **Central is frozen.** Training updates the gate and experts; Central is never trained or saved.
- **`expert_forward().output_text` is argmax over INPUT fragment positions** — a scrambled echo of the question, not a generated answer.
- Therefore **"Sturnus pipeline vs Central-alone" is identical by construction at inference.** The deployed user-facing reply is always `Central.generate(prompt)`.

The harness (`scripts/blind_eval.py`) tests a different question: does injecting expert text into the prompt help? Result on n=3 code queries: expert text changed the output (A≠B) but added only noise — both produced valid answers because Central already knew them.

**This is the most important architectural truth to carry forward:**

> As currently wired, the MoE expert pipeline is a **training-time apparatus**. Experts and the gate matter for the learning objectives (r_i, routing, TKL), but the deployed reply is base Central. To make experts contribute to answers, the design needs: (a) a meaningful expert summary injected into generation (not the argmax echo), or (b) training Central itself (which `scripts/lora_finetune.py --data mixture` does).

### New Artifacts

| file | purpose |
|---|---|
| `data/heldout_eval.jsonl` | 40-prompt balanced held-out set (10 per domain) |
| `evaluation.py` | gate routing accuracy, r_i, expert MSE — skew-immune |
| `scripts/eval_heldout.py` | CLI: cheap gate-only eval by default, `--full` for pipeline |
| `scripts/realistic_workload.py` | cache warming / tau study (`--full` for end-to-end overhead) |
| `scripts/blind_eval.py` | A/B quality harness + GPT-judge scaffold |
| `logs/eval.csv` | per-checkpoint held-out gate accuracy (written by finetune.py) |

**K collapsed from 7 → 1 within 10 batches and held for the entire remainder of the run.** Gate confidence reached 1.0 by batch 7 and never dropped. K mean (last 100) reached 1.0 by batch 500. Core Invariant satisfied and measured.

Timeline A rate reached **33.3%** — one third of all tokens processed with K=0, no experts loaded.

```

**8,556 tok/s peak** when expert is buffered. **980 tok/s floor** when 5 experts load fresh from SSD. The bottleneck is SSD-to-RAM bandwidth, not compute. As routing clusters mature, buffer hit rate rises and average throughput increases.

The thermal regression held the system in a stable envelope across 3+ hours. Temperature stabilised rather than climbing. X_next predictions kept the pipeline below the throttle ceiling throughout.

```
X concurrent experts — thermal regression in action
Boot:       X=11 (Run 1), X=9 (Run 2)  ← RAM-dependent
Mid-run:    X=7  ← regression settled here
Late-run:   X=7  ← held stable
Peak batch: tok/s=10.5 (fresh load) ... up to higher on cache hits
```

## Physical Architecture — Hardware-Aware Execution

### The SSD Problem

Every expert load is a ~900 MB SSD read. Every unload is a RAM flush. On a long task this happens tens of thousands of times. Two consequences: latency (expert in RAM = 8,556 tok/s, expert loading from SSD = 980 tok/s, nine times slower), and hardware wear (NAND flash has finite read/write cycles, continuous loading degrades it, heat builds, SSD thermally throttles, reads slow, pipeline stalls).

Three mechanisms address this.

### Expert Pipeline Prefetch

The gate's look-ahead already produced the full Y schedule before batch one. The system knew what experts were needed for Y2 before Y1 finished. But it wasn't acting on that knowledge — it loaded Y2 after Y1 completed. Pure sequential. Dead time between every batch.

```
Before:  Load Y1 → Run Y1 → Unload Y1 → Load Y2 → Run Y2
After:   Load Y1 → Run Y1 → Unload Y1 → Run Y2
                        ↕
                        Load Y2 while Y1 runs
```

Y2 loads while Y1 computes. Load time is hidden behind compute time. By the time Y1 finishes, Y2 is already in RAM. Zero wait between batches. Gate intelligence now propagates all the way to hardware scheduling.

**Code change:** `splitter.py` — new `prefetch_next_batch()` runs in a background thread. Sets a `threading.Event` when done. Main thread checks event before running next batch. `inference.py` — batch loop kicks off prefetch for next batch immediately after starting current batch.

### Thermal Regression — X Is Now a Learned Variable

X was always `floor(RAM / EXPERT_RAM)`. A constant set at boot. Never changed.

**X is now a prediction.**

Every batch, five hardware observables are read:

```python
thermal_state      # CPU die temp via powermetrics
ram_headroom_mb    # free + inactive pages via vm_stat
ssd_read_rate_mb   # MB/sec from disk0 via iostat
time_in_bound      # wall clock of last Y cycle
tokens_processed   # running total this session
```

An incremental OLS regression fits on the full session history in MLX. Predicts one number: `X_next`. Passed to the gate before the next Y cycle builds.

```
System cool        →  X=6, wide batches, fast
System warming     →  X=4, regression acts before throttle
System predicted
to clog            →  X=2, narrow batches, SSD gets idle time, system cools
System recovered   →  X climbs back
```

This is not throttling. Throttling is reactive — measure heat, hit threshold, slow down. This is prediction — fit the trajectory, act before the ceiling, never hit the ceiling.

**This is the single most important architectural change.** No existing MoE system does this. X is always a config value in every prior system — static, set before the run. In Sturnus it is a runtime output of a model that learns the hardware the same way the system learns language. Different on batch 1 and batch 10,000,000. Different on two identical MacBook Airs running different workloads.

**Code change:** New file `diagnostics.py`. One public method: `update()`. Takes tokens_processed, time_in_bound, x_used. Returns x_next. `splitter.py` — `compute_xy()` gets optional `x_override` param. `configs.py` — four new constants: `THERMAL_THROTTLE_TEMP = 85.0`, `DIAGNOSTICS_SAVE_PATH`, `X_MIN = 1`, `X_MAX = 7`.

### The Unified Physical Process

The three fixes connect to the same underlying process:

```
K → 0          fewer experts needed as routing matures
SSD reads → 0  pipeline eliminates sequential loads
               buffer hit rate rises as clusters mature
               regression reduces X on long tasks, gives SSD idle time
Thermal → 0    idle windows grow as K falls
               regression holds system in stable thermal envelope
```

These are not three separate optimisations. As the system learns language better it needs fewer experts. Fewer experts means shorter Y schedules. Shorter Y schedules means less SSD traffic. Less SSD traffic means longer idle windows. More headroom means X can stay higher. Higher X means faster completion. Less total thermal exposure per task.

**The system gets smarter and cooler and faster by the same mechanism.**

## 8. Setup

**Requirements:** macOS (M-series Apple Silicon), Python 3.11+, HuggingFace token.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ceoAMAN/Sturnus.git
cd Sturnus
python -m venv sturnus-env && source sturnus-env/bin/activate
pip install mlx mlx-lm huggingface_hub numpy faiss-cpu reportlab matplotlib

export HF_TOKEN="hf_your_token_here"
# Or add to ~/.zshrc for persistence

# Run Universal Buffet calibration (pre-deployment, once only)
python main.py --calibrate

# Run fine-tuning
python finetune.py --max-tokens 1000000 --batch-size 256

# Run benchmark
python scripts/benchmark.py
```

### Monitoring and Validation

A training run can be watched live and its metrics extracted for the paper:

```bash
# Live monitor — batch#, tokens, loss, λ, K, tok/s, ETA
python scripts/monitor_validation.py
# or tail the raw log
tail -f logs/validation_1m.log

# After a run completes, extract metrics + plots
python scripts/extract_validation_metrics.py
#   → analysis/metrics_1m.json      all raw metrics
#   → analysis/metrics_1m.csv       loss/λ/clusters/K per checkpoint
#   → analysis/plots/convergence.png        loss, confidence, clusters, K
#   → analysis/plots/lambda_evolution.png   MAML weight emergence

# Skew-immune held-out evals (see §7 Hardening)
python scripts/eval_heldout.py             # cheap: gate routing accuracy
python scripts/eval_heldout.py --full      # heavy: + r_i and expert MSE
python scripts/realistic_workload.py       # cache warming / tau study
python scripts/blind_eval.py --n 8         # A/B quality harness
```

**What a healthy run shows:** loss (routing CE) converges, λ diverges from `[0.25]×4` (MAML working), clusters grow above 0, K drops toward 1, gate confidence rises, and tok/s stays stable (no thermal throttle). The authoritative signal is **held-out gate routing accuracy** in `logs/eval.csv`, not `avg_loss` — see §7.

**MLX memory management note:** `mx.metal.get_active_memory()` returns 0 on M4. Available RAM is measured via `vm_stat` subprocess, parsing free + inactive pages with a 5 GB reservation for the OS, Gate, and Central. This runs before every batch.

**Tokeniser boundary note:** Gate and Experts use the Qwen2.5 tokeniser. Central uses the Mistral tokeniser. Expert outputs are decoded to text before passing to Central. Raw Qwen2.5 token IDs never cross this boundary.

## 10. Architectural Invariants

These invariants must hold at all times. Violation of any one corrupts the self-supervision loop.

1. **K(D,N) strictly non-increasing on average per domain**
2. **Gate NEVER receives task gradients** — only L_gate
3. **β = α × 0.1 always** — structural constraint, enforced in `validate_config()`
4. **Shadow loop mask is structural** (inside loss fn) — overlap produces EXACTLY ZERO gradient
5. **L_eff is a secondary bias + loss term** — Distance to Convolution Peak is the primary ranking signal
6. **Central measures wall-clock time after `mx.eval()`** — never self-reported, never before eval
7. **No constants** — all thresholds relative to runtime observables
8. **Session reset = domain counters + R_t curves ONLY** — weights, routing memory, R_alpha, R_omega persist
9. **Alpha masking never consecutive on same expert**
10. **masking_rate > 0.5 on new expert → established experts protected from Alpha mask**
11. **Experts are never deleted** — they migrate
12. **TKL floor = 32 tokens always** — Shadow Loop handles below this
13. **R_omega >= FRAGMENT_MIN always** — nadir floor never below hard semantic floor
14. **X, Y, R_out, R_out_mean are runtime-computed** — never stored in configs
15. **DEVICE = None in configs** — MLX manages unified memory
16. **Prompt #1 is a calculated execution** — Universal Buffet ships calibration curves at deployment
17. **Dead-time B run sets `send_to_user=False`** — output dropped, never shown
18. **Dead-time B run fires only when inference queue is empty** — never concurrent with live inference
19. **HF_TOKEN must be set before boot** — `authenticate_huggingface()` enforces this as a hard precondition
20. **Expert outputs decoded to text before Central ingestion** — Mistral tokeniser boundary never crossed with raw Qwen2.5 token IDs

## 11. Acceptance Criteria

All six must pass simultaneously before capacity scaling:

| # | Observable | Measurement | Pass Condition |
|---|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | K-Velocity negative | ΔK per 1,000 tokens per domain | >10% decrease |
| 2 | Dot product relevance stable | R_i mean over rolling 100-token window | Non-decreasing |
| 3 | Expert weight divergence | std(all expert weight matrices) | Strictly increasing |
| 4 | Central entropy non-increasing | Cross-entropy of synthesis as K falls | Flat or decreasing |
| 5 | Routing memory hit rate rising | Cluster hits / total tokens | Rising over session |
| 6 | Timeline A rate rising | Timeline A tokens / total tokens | Rising with domain familiarity |

## 12. Limitations and Future Work

| Limitation | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Expert text quality drives synthesis quality** | Experts now generate real text (not argmax-over-input echoes), which is appended to the prompt and fed into Central's synthesis backbone. Central trains on this augmented input, learning to weight expert context. However, expert text quality is bounded by the experts' own capabilities — if experts are undertrained, Central has poor material to work with. Improving this boundary requires deeper expert specialisation (via longer training runs or domain-specific pretraining) or injecting external reasoning/search results into the expert stream. |
| **Gate routing accuracy near chance** | On a balanced 40-prompt held-out set the gate routes at 30% (chance = 25%). The domain mixture was skewed, masking this with a near-zero routing CE loss. The de-skewed mixture (local_custom 0.10) + `logs/eval.csv` tracking sets up the next run to actually measure improvement. |
| **Voronoi cache: consistency, not speed** | Hit rate warms to 93% on repeated queries but latency speedup is 1.0×. The gate forward (~23 ms) dominates; expert selection is near-free. Cache value is routing consistency across paraphrases, not raw speed. |
| **Single hardware validation** | All numbers measured on one MacBook Air M4 16 GB. Multi-device and cross-hardware validation outstanding. |
| **`avg_loss` is routing CE, not LM loss** | Never use `avg_loss → 0` as evidence of language-modeling quality. The correct metric is held-out gate routing accuracy and r_i. |

## 13. Related Work

**Mixture-of-Experts:** Shazeer et al. (2017) introduced sparsely-gated MoE layers. Switch Transformer (Fedus et al., 2021) scaled to trillion parameters with one-expert-per-token routing. GLaM (Du et al., 2021) demonstrated MoE quality matching at a fraction of dense activated parameters. Critical distinction from all prior work: every existing MoE system treats K as fixed at design time. Sturnus treats K as the primary observable of system health and drives it toward zero across sessions.

**On-Device Inference:** llama.cpp (Gerganov, 2023) enables quantised LLM inference on consumer hardware. Apple MLX (2023) provides native array operations on Apple Silicon unified memory. GPTQ (Frantar et al., 2022), GGUF, and AWQ reduce individual model footprints. None address the challenge of coordinating multiple models dynamically. Sturnus operates at this level — SSD as infinite expert reservoir, unified memory as bounded execution window.

**Meta-Learning:** MAML (Finn et al., 2017) provides the foundation for the lambda outer loop. The structural constraint β = α × 0.1 diverges from standard MAML — equal learning rates cause lambda to oscillate under lagged feedback. FOMAML by default; full second-order via `mx.vjp` reserved for K-Velocity benchmark failure.

**Self-Supervised Learning:** The dot-product peer pressure gradient is related to contrastive methods (Chen et al., 2020; He et al., 2020) but differs fundamentally: no data pairs, no labels, no human feedback. The signal derives purely from geometric relationships between model weight matrices. Self-terminates when specialisation is complete.
